SHORT TERM
=====================================

Lexical analyzer/parser
    * We need to change the way we handle negative numbers- currently it doesn't work
    * The preprocessor needs a lot of love
    
MID-TERM
=====================================

I really want all the x86-64 assembly to be ported to my Asmx86 project.

I don't want to re-write the parser, but it needs a lot of work

I think blocks need work

LONG-TERM
=====================================

Replace that token structure with something more conventional (I don't love how we currently pass structures around)
    -> That said, I do kind of like how we parse line-by-line; it fits the syntax of the language
